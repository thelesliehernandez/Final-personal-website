                I'm Leslie Hernandez and I am from Winchester,KY. I went to George Rogers Clark all through high school.
                I turned 18 years old two days before I started my freshman year of college. I am majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Math.
                I currently go to Northern Kentucky University. I played soccer since i was 3 years old, until i decided 
                to quit after my senior year of high school.I traveled a lot around the country playing my whole life. I made a lot
                of friends and met so many new people that i am still close with today. I have also met a lot of new people at NKU so far.
                I have one younger sister, Carla, who is about to turn 14 in November. She has been my best friend since she was born. We 
                are super close and i miss her being around when i am away at college. We both live with our dad and all three of us love
                are very close. My dad has always been very supportive of me my whole life through soccer or school or just in general.
                I have two dogs, Star and Midnight. Star is a full blooded pitbull and Midnight is a lab/boxer mix.
                I am also very close with my boyfriend, Cameron.
