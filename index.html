        <h2 style="color:black;font-family: monospace;">HISTORY OF THE DONKEY</h2>
        <div style=" line-height:1.5; color:black; font-size:15px; font-family: monospace;">
          <p>
            Although millions of years ago donkeys and horses had the same ancestors they have evolved to be very different species and understanding those differences are of vital importance to the care and welfare of donkeys.
            There are two distinct species of wild donkey; the Asiatic branch of the species came from an area stretching from the Red Sea to Northern India and Tibet where the ass had to adapt to different climate, terrain and altitude.
            Consequently there is more than one type of Asiatic wild ass. The African branch of the species was found in North Africa between the Mediterranean coast and the Sahara Desert to the south of the Red Sea.
            There were two separate species of the African ass: the Nubian wild ass and the Somali wild ass. 
            Our modern domesticated donkeys are all descended from these African wild asses ancestors.
            Donkeys were first domesticated around 6,000 years ago in North Africa and Egypt for meat and milk. 
            Around 2,000 years ago donkeys were among the draught animals used to carry silk from the Pacific Ocean to the Mediterranean along the Silk Road in return for trade goods. 
            The overland route was approximately 4,000 miles or 6,400km and lasted several years. 
            No single animal completed the entire journey and mixing of breeds occurred as unplanned matings happened en-route to give us the beginnings of the diverse range of donkey breeds we now have. 
            The journey ended in the Mediterranean ports of Greece, Italy, the Middle East and Alexandria in Egypt. 
            In Greece donkeys were found to be ideal animals for working on the narrow paths between the vines. 
            Their use for cultivation in vineyards spread through the Mediterranean countries to Spain, whose coast at the southern tip is separated from North Africa by only a few miles - possibly another entry route for the African wild ass.

        <h2 style="color:black;font-family: monospace;">WHAT DO DONKEYS NEED?</h2>
          <p>
            Donkeys are typically very sweet and gentle, and can make great pets! 
            They are quite smart, however, and hate being yelled at or forced into anything. 
            Always be gentle with your donkey. Offer treats (hint: apples) and ear scritches, and let him or herget to know you. 
            If you're a first-time donkey owner, choose one that's already trained. Teaching these guys to walk on a lead or offer their feet on command definitely takes a practiced touch!
            Donkeys are definitely not well-suited to living alone. 
            A donkey without any buddies will quickly get sad, depressed, and lonely. 
            They form incredibly strong bonds with their pals, so we strongly recommend keeping bonded pairs together for life. 
            Donkeys can also bond with horses. However, if the horse is sold or moved, you will soon find yourself with a sad donkey on your hands, which is actually quite heartbreaking to behold. 
            Everyone needs friends!Donkeys must have a clean, dry barn, or, at the very least, a three-sided shelter. You'll have to remove waste from this area daily. 
            Your donkey will also need access to some sort of pasturage, as they really need space to wander and nibble.
            Many donkeys don't care for chilly climates. In fact, they're prone to getting pneumonia in cold or wet weather! You may want to keep your donkey blanketed in winter.
            Your donkey will still need some activity, of course. Exercise him indoors, or choose milder days to let him out.
            Like other equines, donkeys are herbivores, and need lots of plant fiber. 
            A high fiber/low sugar diet is ideal. Good barley straw supplemented with hay is an excellent choice. 
            Avoid cereal grain, as it isn't safe for donkeys. Your vet may also recommend vitamin and/or mineral supplements. 
            Fresh water, of course, is an absolute must.Just like any other pet, donkeys need regular veterinary care. Regular exams, vaccinations, and worming are all important. 
            You'll also need to keep up with your donkeyâ€™s hoof and dental care needs. Ask your vet for recommendations.
